<h1><p align="center">Before you interact</h1>

-I'm 16, anyone below 14 or above 18 please iwec.


-I'm always standoffish, sorry.

-I'm dyslexic & prone to having typos/errors in whatever the freak I'm saying. Typing quirks are hard for me to read as well, sorry again. :(

-The mention of vomit/puking or along the lines of it leading up to that triggers me bad. I'll hide you for 15 minutes if I see the mentions of it.😓

-I **AM** a Fictionkin! Doubles I don't quite mind :) However,, Jabber fictives/fictionkins make me slightly uncomfortable if interactions are romantic, for I am happily taken by my girlfriend @IWantAC00lName :D

<h1><p align="center">DNI.</h1>

-Basic DNI such as racism, homophobia, you get the point.

-Trump supporters.

-Generally annoying people. I don't care if you're " silly xP " leave me the hell alone.

-People who ageplay,, duh. That's gross and makes littles look bad.

-The person that had the nerve to send rape threats to me through strawpage around 25 times.
