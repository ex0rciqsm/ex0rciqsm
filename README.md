Hi! You can just call me Zanka. ^_^ I'm the Host and will be the person you see most of the time. 
<h2><h2>
  Main Boundaries for both myself and the rest of our system❗❗⬇️
<h2></h2>
  
  *Please refrain from anything sexual towards or near the littles, that's pretty obvious.*
  
  *The mention of vomit or anything slightly resembling puking triggers us bad. DNI if you don't respect that.*

  *Cuddling and/or hiding behind us is appreciated ONLY from our partner and close friends. ^_^;*

  *Copying ponies =✖️(again, unless you are our partner or close friend of ours.) BUT INSPO IS OKAY😋👍*

  *Don't beg for socials. We won't share them until we trust you.* /aimed

  *Interacting(such as whispers) is a-okay unless stated otherwise in our name.*

  **WE DON'T BELIEVE IN TOUCH TRIGGERS** *_but_* *if they make you more comfortable have fun.*

  *Hate towards any of our headmates will get you blocked or hid for 15 minutes😓.*
